LXR-OWL Drumsynth Firmware
====================================
This version is a fork from PLD/RUDEOG that contains all original code and many new features (I called this version OWL as some of the plug ins added are coming from the nice project OWL http://hoxtonowl.com/patches-2/ ):

### 1. You can select among 72 pre filled patterns for each voice
* Select a track (1-7), then, 
* Click on the button VOICE, then, 
* Click on the OSC menu to access the extra features :-)

### 2. You can randomize steps/patterns for each voice, creating surprising drum lines!
* Select a track (1-7), then, 
* Click on the button VOICE, then, 
* Click on the OSC menu to access the extra features :-)

### 3. You can randomize the sound parameters of each voice, creating quickly news percussion sounds!
* Select a track (1-7), then, 
* Click on the button VOICE, then, 
* Click on the OSC menu to access the extra features :-)
* You will see a menu called RND turn the knob from OFF to ON to listen to the new sound!
* Knob 1 is used to choose which parameters you want to randomize:
* Knob 2 is used to ARM the randomize function (ON/OFF).

### 4. You can make a LOOP/DIVIDE effect like on the Arturia Spark machine
* Select the PERF button, then,
* Choose from steps 9 to 16.
* Step 9 = Reset the loop to its original state.
* Step 10 = Loop from x to y
* Step 11 = Loop from x to y
* Step 12 = Loop from x to y
* Step 13 = Loop from x to y
* Step 14 = Loop from x to y
* Step 15 = Loop from x to y
* Step 16 = Loop from x to y

### 5. Sounds effect (Compressor, Bit crusher, Bit reduce, OTO biscuit FX alike, Bit reverse, etc)
* Select the PERF button, then,
* Click again the PERF button to access the sub menu. 
* You will see a menu **FX VL1 VL2 WET**
# FX : Select the FX you want to apply :
- 1: Simple compressor (VL1 = sensitivity, VL2 = Compression level)
- 2: OTO biscuit - (VL1 = Forward/Backward, VL2 = Bit Rotate level)
- 3: Strange Low Pass Filter (VL1 = Lambda, VL2 = Filter Gain)
- 4: Decimator (VL1 = ReduceBits, VL2 = Rate)
- 5: Bit Reversed (VL1 = BitRotate, VL2 = nothing)
- 6: Small Bit Reversed (VL1 = VL2 = nothing, level)
- 7: Tabaria Wave Shaper
- 8: Disto Wave Shaper
- 9-16: not working yet.
# if you use the FXs, they will bring a lot of overdrive and 8 bits sounds. To fuly enjoy the sounds, mute the track 1, the BD/kick.. otherwise you will get very strong OVERDRIVE sounds :-)

Enjoy!
:-)
